# 2023 Advent of Code Repository

The code in this repository is the work of SmartDude04 for the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) coding challenges.

## Structure

Each day is organized into a folder. Inside those folders, two files of code (one for each challenge) are included, as well as the example input and the input given to me (inputs hidden in .gitignore to [preserve AoC](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying)).

## Use

This repo is only intended to be viewed to see how I completed each puzzle. **Do not attempt to copy this code to complete the challenges**. That defeats the purpose of the puzzles.
